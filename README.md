# My Coding Prep

I always had this problem where I have done some problems and understood it in that moment, but later in time, it fades away like I have never done it before. Super Frustrating.

So I am here creating this repo to have sure I create notes for all algorithms to look back and refresh my memory.

There are several topics that needs to be covered in my opinion.

- List/Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Linked List
- Tree (binary mostly)
- BST
- Graph
- Recursion
- Sorting 
- BFS
- DFS
- Binary Search
